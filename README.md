# Coding Exercise for Catapult
Coding Challenge for Catapult Sports.

Your goal is to set up a single page application (SPA) using React that will consume an API, display information for the user using any charting library of your choice. The topic, application design (how the website looks and feels) is up to you.

3.	Explain with examples how you would integrate the front end and back end implementations  (Mock data for frontend etc.).  
4.	Test your components using a testing framework of choice (Jest, Mocha, Chai, etc)
